            <p id="welcome-text">This site was launched to promote the diffusion of knowledge within the computer science community, especially for those who are self-taught. Every soften I find myself trying to perform a task for which no up-to-date guide is available, leaving me to find a solution on my own. This usually requires visiting multiple sources and gaining a deeper understanding for the problem at hand, which can become time consuming and overwhelming. Therefore, to prevent others from having to endure the same struggle as me, I will be consolidating what I learned throughout my journeys.</p>
